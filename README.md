# Chicago Lakeview Coffee Shops App

## Getting Started

### Heroku Website

<https://quiet-journey-55388.herokuapp.com/>

### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to create a profile page with my information like name, email, profile picture. 

When I am logged in as a user, I can browse local coffee shops that are in my local Chicago neighborhood, Lakeview. Each coffee shop will have it's own profile with the shop's information and any posts/ratings that other users have written about that shop. I can write a rating by adding a comment and a value of 1-5. 

As a user, if there is a coffee shop that does not currently have a profile page, I can create it by adding the shop's name, picture, and basic information. I can not create a profile page for a coffee shop that already exists in the database.
