# Chicago Lakeview Coffee Shops App

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to create a profile page with my information like name, email, profile picture. On my profile, I also want to be able to see all of my posts and view a list of coffee shops I want to visit and check off those coffee shops when I have visited. 

When I am logged in as a user, I can browse local coffee shops that are in my local Chicago neighborhood, Lakeview. Each coffee shop will have it's own profile with the shop's information and any posts/ratings that other users have written about that shop. I can write a rating by adding a value of 1-5, writing a post, and adding an image if I'd like. I can also see their average rating based on all ratings that have been posted by other users. 

As a user, if there is a coffee shop that does not currently have a profile page, I can create it by adding the shop's name, picture, and basic information. I can not create a profile page for a coffee shop that already exists in the database.
